"""Numeric Langfuse scores that make a spoke's metadata chartable (#100, #101, #158).

Langfuse dashboards can sum/aggregate numeric SCORES but not arbitrary observation metadata, so

per-tool ``permission_wait_ms`` / ``tool_result_size`` and the trace-level ``gate_park_ms`` (from

``step_cost_usd`` / ``step_tokens_written`` from View B's step rollups. Depends on the foundation,
